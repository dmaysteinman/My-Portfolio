# Responsive Portfolio
## Description: 
This is my updated portfolio assignment

I just edited my old portfolio and updated it instead of building a new one from scratch. Though this decision was the result of laziness, it ended being great because I got to see how far I've come with CSS styling and HTML. 

## Tech stack: 
Layouts of the pages were build with bootstrap and with css built by me

### Background image: 
the background image is from a book from a German (probably) book on botany from The Lloyd Library (https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/263976#page/188/mode/1up)

Index page includes an adorable picture of me and a quick bio
