# Responsive_Portfolio
This is my responsive portfolio assignment

I'm still not entirely sure what a readme is for. I'd love some more input or an example of a succeessfully written one. 

The purpose of this assignment was to create a personal portfolio page with responsive links and images

Layouts of the pages were build with bootstrap and with css built by me

the background image is an image of cheesepaper that I edited to make lighter so it was less distracting. [This is the image I used](https://www.fromagex.com/pub/media/catalog/product/cache/05c056f81be49f7758d477b418e948c4/P/4/P401SPLDFB_1_1.jpg)

Index page includes an adorable picture of me and a quick bio ![index screenshot](../Responsive_Portfolio/screenshots/index.png)
