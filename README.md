# Responsive Portfolio
## Description: 
This is my updated portfolio assignment

I just edited my old portfolio and updated it instead of building a new one from scratch. Though this decision was the result of laziness, it ended being great because I got to see how far I've come with CSS styling and HTML based on what I made a few weeks ago. 

## Tech stack: 
Layouts of the pages were build with bootstrap and with css built by me. One of the challenges I ran into here was updating my old css tags and other things into things I could find easily. I've figured out that grouping things in css based on things like "md-4-sm" was really annoying.
